Treat the task initially as simply a generation of a positional postings for a single
input file specified on the command line.  Your output index will simply have 1 reference
document and each term's posititional index in the document.  This will give you the
opportunity to check the terms that you're generating for the dictionary and help you
to generalize to the case where you have multiple input files.

Run the program on your program  That is to say, use the program source code as the file
that is being parsed.  Make sure that you are stripping out punctuation appropriately.
[The first thing that I do when grading your program is to run the program on your program
and look at the results.]

If you develop on your own resources, periodically push the code up to storm.cs.uni.edu to
compile and run.  Don't get into the situation where you're scrambling to adhere to the
submission requirements at the last minute.
