# Intro

Information Retrieval (IR) i finding material (usually documents) of an unstructured
nature (usually text) that satisfies an information need from within large collections
(usually stored on computers).

There's been a large change in unstructured data being much more important and valuable
in the most recent years.

Why can't we just use grep? Well, it's line oriented and performs stateless checks. So
it can be hard to build tools upon pure grep.
